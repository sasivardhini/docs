## Rate Limiting

DevEntry uses a **two-tier rate limiting system** to ensure fair usage and API stability.

### How Rate Limits Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hourly Limits (Requests Per Hour)" icon="clock">
    Prevents bursts of traffic that could overload the API.
    
    - **Free**: 100 requests/hour
    - **Basic**: 400 requests/hour
    - **Pro**: 1,000 requests/hour
    - **Business**: 4,000 requests/hour
    
    Resets every hour at the top of the hour (e.g., 10:00, 11:00, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monthly Limits (Requests Per Month)" icon="calendar">
    Ensures sustained usage stays within tier limits.
    
    - **Free**: 3,000 requests/month
    - **Basic**: 12,000 requests/month
    - **Pro**: 60,000 requests/month
    - **Business**: 300,000 requests/month
    
    Resets on the 1st of each month at 00:00 UTC
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes rate limit information in the headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 87
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1699272000

X-RateLimit-Monthly-Limit: 3000
X-RateLimit-Monthly-Remaining: 2856
X-RateLimit-Monthly-Reset: 1701388800
```

**Header Descriptions:**

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum hourly requests allowed |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Remaining hourly requests |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when hourly limit resets |
| `X-RateLimit-Monthly-Limit` | Maximum monthly requests allowed |
| `X-RateLimit-Monthly-Remaining` | Remaining monthly requests |
| `X-RateLimit-Monthly-Reset` | Unix timestamp when monthly limit resets |

### Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "detail": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "limit_type": "hourly",
  "limit": 100,
  "used": 100,
  "reset_at": "2025-11-06T11:00:00Z"
}
```

<Warning>
  **Blocked Requests**: Once rate limited, all requests will be rejected until the limit resets. Plan your usage accordingly!
</Warning>

## Usage Monitoring

Track your API usage in real-time to avoid hitting limits.

### Check Usage Statistics

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api-keys/deventry_a1b2c3d4/usage' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "key_prefix": "deventry_a1b2c3d4",
  "pricing_tier": "free",
  "usage": {
    "hourly": {
      "used": 45,
      "limit": 100,
      "remaining": 55,
      "reset_at": "2025-11-06T11:00:00Z"
    },
    "monthly": {
      "used": 1250,
      "limit": 3000,
      "remaining": 1750,
      "reset_at": "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "last_used": "2025-11-06T10:45:23Z"
}
```

- Are building a Chrome extension or mobile app
- Want headroom for future growth

**Typical Usage**: ~2,000 API calls = 10-15 syncs per day

---

### Business - $49/month

## Cost Optimization Tips

<Tip>
  **Minimize Syncs**: Only sync when you receive new emails. Use webhooks or scheduled jobs instead of polling.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Cache Data**: Store job data locally and only refresh when needed. Use `last_updated` timestamp to check for changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Batch Operations**: If you need to check multiple users, batch your requests efficiently within rate limits.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check `/api-keys/{prefix}/usage` to avoid surprise rate limit hits.
</Tip>

## Upgrading Your Tier

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Current Usage">
    Review your usage statistics to determine if an upgrade is needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New API Key">
    Create a new API key with the desired pricing tier
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Applications">
    Replace the old API key in your applications with the new one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revoke Old Key">
    Optionally revoke the old API key after migration
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **No Automatic Upgrades**: You must create a new API key with the upgraded tier. Existing keys cannot be upgraded in-place.
</Warning>
